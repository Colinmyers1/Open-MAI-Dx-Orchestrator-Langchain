MAI-DxO (MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator) is a sophisticated AI-powered diagnostic system that simulates a virtual panel of physician-agents to perform iterative medical diagnosis with cost-effectiveness optimization. This implementation faithfully reproduces the methodology described in the Microsoft Research paper while providing additional features and flexibility.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Install the package
pip install mai-dx

# Or install from source
git clone https://github.com/The-Swarm-Corporation/Open-MAI-Dx-Orchestrator.git
cd Open-MAI-Dx-Orchestrator
pip install -e .
```

---- 

## Enivronement Configuration
Configure your api keys and environment variables like the following. 

```txt
WORKSPACE_DIR="" # for the swarms library
OPENAI_API_KEY="" # Your model api key
GEMINI_API_KEY="" # your gemini api key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""
```

----

## Example

```python
from mai_dx import MaiDxOrchestrator

# Create orchestrator
orchestrator = MaiDxOrchestrator(model_name="gemini/gemini-2.5-flash")

# Run diagnosis
result = orchestrator.run(
    initial_case_info="29-year-old woman with sore throat and peritonsillar swelling...",
    full_case_details="Patient: 29-year-old female. History: Onset of sore throat...",
    ground_truth_diagnosis="Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the pharynx"
)

print(f"Diagnosis: {result.final_diagnosis}")
print(f"Accuracy: {result.accuracy_score}/5.0")
print(f"Cost: ${result.total_cost:,}")
```
