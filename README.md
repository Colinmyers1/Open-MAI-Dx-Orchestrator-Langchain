# MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator (MAI-DxO)

> **An open-source implementation of Microsoft Research's "Sequential Diagnosis with Language Models" paper, built with LangGraph for state-managed multi-agent orchestration.**

MAI-DxO (MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator) is a sophisticated AI-powered diagnostic system that simulates a virtual panel of physician-agents to perform iterative medical diagnosis with cost-effectiveness optimization. This implementation faithfully reproduces the methodology described in the Microsoft Research paper while leveraging LangGraph's powerful state management and workflow orchestration capabilities.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **8 AI Physician Agents**: Specialized roles orchestrated through LangGraph state management.
- **5 Operational Modes**: Instant, question-only, budgeted, no-budget, and ensemble modes.
- **State-Managed Workflow**: LangGraph handles all state transitions and persistence automatically.
- **Cost Tracking**: Real-time budget monitoring with costs for 25+ medical tests.
- **Clinical Evaluation**: 5-point accuracy scoring with detailed feedback.
- **Model Agnostic**: Works with GPT, Gemini, Claude, and other leading LLMs through LangChain.
- **Graph-Based Architecture**: Declarative workflow definition with conditional routing and checkpointing.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install the requirements:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/colinmyers/Open-MAI-Dx-Orchestrator-Langchain.git
cd Open-MAI-Dx-Orchestrator-Langchain
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For development mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project root and add your API keys:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your API keys:
# GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
# OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here" 
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key_here"
```

### 3. Basic Usage

```python
from mai_dx import MaiDxOrchestrator

# Create the orchestrator (defaults to a capable model)
orchestrator = MaiDxOrchestrator()

# Run a diagnosis
result = orchestrator.run(
    initial_case_info="29-year-old woman with sore throat and peritonsillar swelling...",
    full_case_details="Patient: 29-year-old female. History: Onset of sore throat...",
    ground_truth_diagnosis="Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the pharynx"
)

# Print the results
print(f"Final Diagnosis: {result.final_diagnosis}")
print(f"Accuracy: {result.accuracy_score}/5.0")
print(f"Total Cost: ${result.total_cost:,.2f}")
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Usage & Configuration

Customize the orchestrator's model, budget, and operational mode.

```python
from mai_dx import MaiDxOrchestrator

# Configure with a specific model and budget
orchestrator = MaiDxOrchestrator(
    model_name="gemini/gemini-2.5-flash",  # or "gpt-4", "claude-3-5-sonnet"
    max_iterations=10,
    initial_budget=3000,
    mode="budgeted"  # Other modes: "instant", "question_only", "no_budget"
)

# Run the diagnosis
# ...
```

## üè• How It Works: The Virtual Physician Panel

MAI-DxO employs a LangGraph-orchestrated multi-agent system where each agent operates as a graph node with state-aware processing:

- **üß† Dr. Hypothesis**: Maintains the differential diagnosis.
- **üî¨ Dr. Test-Chooser**: Selects the most cost-effective diagnostic tests.
- **ü§î Dr. Challenger**: Prevents cognitive biases and diagnostic errors.
- **üí∞ Dr. Stewardship**: Ensures cost-effective care.
- **‚úÖ Dr. Checklist**: Performs quality control checks.
- **ü§ù Consensus Coordinator**: Synthesizes panel decisions.
- **üîë Gatekeeper**: Acts as the clinical information oracle.
- **‚öñÔ∏è Judge**: Evaluates the final diagnostic accuracy.
