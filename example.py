    Patient: 29-year-old female.
    History: Onset of sore throat 7 weeks prior to admission. Worsening right-sided pain and swelling.
    No fevers, headaches, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Past medical history is unremarkable. No history of smoking or significant alcohol use.
    Physical Exam: Right peritonsillar mass, displacing the uvula. No other significant findings.
    Initial Labs: FBC, clotting studies normal.
    MRI Neck: Showed a large, enhancing mass in the right peritonsillar space.
    Biopsy (H&E): Infiltrative round-cell neoplasm with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and frequent mitotic figures.
    Biopsy (Immunohistochemistry for Carcinoma): CD31, D2-40, CD34, ERG, GLUT-1, pan-cytokeratin, CD45, CD20, CD3 all negative. Ki-67: 60% nuclear positivity.
    Biopsy (Immunohistochemistry for Rhabdomyosarcoma): Desmin and MyoD1 diffusely positive. Myogenin multifocally positive.
    Biopsy (FISH): No FOXO1 (13q14) rearrangements detected.
